5. The file:
	- find_best_clusters.m
    - similarity.m
are two functions used respectively to evaluate the best cluster on a dataset using a fixed range of k clusters, and to calculate the adjacency matrix based on the pairwise distances
between the points of a matrix X, considering only the k closest neighbours for each point.
