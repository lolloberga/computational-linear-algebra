REQUIREMENTS
	- Python 3.8.10 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/)

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a virtual environment with required libraries

	1a) Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing this repository on your PC
	1b) Once you are there, create a virtual environment by typing the following command:
			python -m venv nameOfYourEnv
	1c) Activate the just created virtual environment by typing in the terminal:
		- For Windows: <env_name>\Scripts\activate.bat
		- For Unix/Linux: source <env_name>/bin/activate
	1d) Install the required libraries by running the following command:
	pip install -r "/[path to requirements]/requirements.txt"
	[note that the requirements.txt file is in the HW_FREE folder]
	1e) When the installations are completed, you may close the terminal.

2. In a code editor, go on "File", then "Open folder" and browse to the location where you downloaded this repository and select the HW_FREE folder, then hit "open" to open it.

3. Select the Python interpreter for the project:
	Open the command palette in your code editor (usually accessible through Ctrl + Shift + P).
	Search for "Python: Select Interpreter" and choose it.
	From the list of available interpreters, select the virtual environment you created in step 1. This will ensure that the project uses the correct Python version and libraries. If you do not see it in the list, navigate to the folder where you installed the virtual environment, then "bin", then select "python" as the interpreter.

4. The files:
	- main_deflation_method.py
	- main_inverse_power_method.py
are the entry point of the execution, you can run the program in this way: "python main_deflation_method.py" or using the inverse power method. It is possible to see the output of each execution in the "figs" directory.

5. The file "utils.py" contains some useful functions that have been used to generate sparse matrices for the testing of the deflation_method and inverse_power_method.
